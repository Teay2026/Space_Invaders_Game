This is a Space Invaders game scripted in Python using the `Tkinter` library. Tkinter is a standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It provides a set of tools and widgets (pre-built graphical components) that allow developers to create windows, dialog boxes, buttons, textboxes, and other elements commonly found in graphical applications.
